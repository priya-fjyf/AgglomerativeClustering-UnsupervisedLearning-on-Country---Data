# 📂 Agglomerative Clustering — Unsupervised Learning on Country Dataset 🌍
## 🚀 Project Overview
### This repository demonstrates the application of Agglomerative Clustering, a hierarchical clustering technique, on the Country Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various socio-economic and health 
### indicators of different countries. Using unsupervised learning, this project groups countries based on similarities in these features without any labeled outcomes.

## Hierarchical clustering is useful for discovering natural groupings in data and understanding the structure through dendrograms. This project covers the complete pipeline — from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, visualization, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
### Name: Country Dataset
### Source: Kaggle - Unsupervised Learning on Country Data
### Description: The dataset includes multiple socio-economic, health, and demographic attributes of various countries worldwide, which provide a rich base for clustering.

## 🔑 Features Used
### Typical features may include (based on dataset availability):
### 💰 GDP per capita
### 📚 Literacy rate etc.
## ✨ Project Highlights
### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features
### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and patterns
### 🏷️ Agglomerative Clustering: Implementing hierarchical clustering with different linkage methods (ward, complete, average)
### 🌳 Dendrogram Visualization: Displaying hierarchical relationships between countries
### 📂 Cluster Analysis: Examining clusters and interpreting grouped countries
